The licenses of this software (GPL) and the one of OpenSSL are incompatible
according to Debian's position. OpenSSL is used in 2 places:
The first one is a module called "licensing" that can be deactivated using
a preprocessor definition. The module doesn't seem suitable for free software
anyway. It removes a line giving credit to the karlyriceditor program from
the rendered videos, if a valid license is installed. However, it doesn't
become clear, how such a "license" could be obtained. Besides, the software is
licensed under the GPL, so every user is able and allowed to remove the credit
line anyway.
The second place is a reader for the "Karafun" file format. Its decryption
functionality, which uses OpenSSL, can be deactivated via a preprocessor
definition. The reader then supports only unencrypted files and will give an
error message, when trying to load encrypted files.

Description: Fix crash on Debian wheezy
 On Debian wheezy the executable "karlyriceditor" crashes on startup with the
 following message:
 > QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running
 > Segmentation fault
 The reason was an inadequate use of the (dangerous) qPrintable macro. The
 macro evaluates to a pointer that points to memory within a temporary object.
 So this pointer becomes invalid as soon as the whole expression is evaluated.
 If the pointer has to be used outside of this expression then either its
 content has to be copied (and deleted when no longer needed) or (what is done
 in this patch) the temporary object has to be stored in a local variable.

Karaoke Lyrics Editor is a program which lets you edit and synchronize
lyrics with karaoke songs in varions formats. Unlike just regular lyrics
available everywhere, lyrics suitable for karaoke players need to have
timing marks which tell the player when to show a specific line, and
when and how highlight the words.

Description: Get rid of linkage against OpenSSL
 The licenses of this package (GPL) and the one of OpenSSL are incompatible
 according to Debian's position. So we get rid of the module "licensing" that
 links against OpenSSL. It's not useful for free software anyway: If the user
 has got a valid license installed, a line giving credit to the karlyriceditor
 program is no longer shown in the rendered videos. Besides, it doesn't become
 clear, how such a "license" could be obtained.
